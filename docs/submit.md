# Submit a Game

Want to add a game to the directory?

**[Open a submission on GitHub](https://github.com/andrewgy8/hnarcade/issues/new?template=submit-game.yml)** and fill out the form. We'll review it and add it to the directory.

## Criteria

The game should have been posted as a **Show HN** on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). It can be any genre or platform — browser games, mobile, desktop, open-source, commercial, whatever.

## What we'll need

- **Game name**
- **Link to play** the game
- **Hacker News thread** link (the Show HN post)
- **Author name** and optional website/profile
- **Tags** (genre, platform, etc.)
- **Short description** of what makes the game interesting
