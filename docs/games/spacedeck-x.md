## About

SpaceDeck is a combination of Shoot-Em-Up and Deck Building - an ambitious goal, but the result is a fun little game. It combines the hectic shmup action with turn based boss fights. If you are not sure what does this mean, try the tutorial it should help.

It is still being developed, with some big updates coming soon!
