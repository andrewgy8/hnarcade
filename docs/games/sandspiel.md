## About

Sandspiel is a pixel physics simulation sandbox. Pick from elements like sand, water, fire, oil, plants, and more, then paint them onto the canvas and watch the simulation play out. Elements interact with each other — fire burns plants, water flows downhill, seeds grow into trees. Built with Rust compiled to WebAssembly for performance.
