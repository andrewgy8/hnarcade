## About

Hey space pilots!
I've been building DELVE - a multiplayer space survival game that runs entirely in your browser. Just made it public and would love for you to check it out!

What is it? Think cooperative wave survival meets persistent MMO universe. You can play solo or team up with friends to fight endless zombie waves, OR explore a galaxy of 10+ star systems with PVP combat, autopilot navigation, and persistent progression.

Two Game Modes: - Wave Mode (Co-op PvE) - Team up with up to 8 players - Fight endless waves of increasingly difficult enemies - Level up, collect gems, unlock abilities - Quick-start feature to skip early waves - Global leaderboards

MMO Mode (Persistent Universe) - Explore 10+ interconnected star systems - Dock at space stations (your progress saves!) - Autopilot navigation between systems - PVP combat in low-security zones - Target other players, engage in tactical ship battles - Real-time shield/health systems

Core Features: - 4 Unique Ships - Each with special abilities (shield boost, rapid fire, repair drone, energy burst) - Real-time Multiplayer - Powered by Photon Cloud, buttery smooth netcode - Zero Install - Runs in your browser, works on mobile too - Progression System - Unlock ships, collect fragments, climb leaderboards - Spectacular VFX - Particle effects, warp-in animations, ability visuals

Ship Progression Roadmap Right now you can fly 4 starter ships (Shuttles - Tier 1)

Currently Playable: - Vanguard Mk I - Tank/Frontline (Shield Boost ability) - Striker Mk I - DPS/Assault (Rapid Fire ability) - Engineer Mk I - Support/Deployer (Repair Drone ability) - Arcanist Mk I - Techno-mage (Energy Burst ability)

Coming Soon: Tier 2 - Frigates (4 ships) Light warships with improved stats and enhanced abilities like Fortress Protocol and Blitz Attack Tier 2 - Interceptors (4 ships) Lightning-fast fighters including the Raptor (Afterburner), Viper (Precision Strike), Phoenix (Evasive Maneuvers), and Wraith (Phase Dash) Tier 3 - Cruisers (4 ships) Balanced warships like the Valiant (Broadside), Crimson (Assault Mode), Horizon (Shield Matrix), and Phantom (Cloak) Tier 4 - Destroyers (4 ships) Heavy hitters including Atlas (Siege Mode), Reaper (Death Strike - 500% damage!), Sentinel (Fortress Shield), and Eclipse (Void Cannon) Tier 5 - Battle Cruisers (4 ships) Legendary vessels like Leviathan, Warlord (Berserker Mode), Bastion (Fleet Command), and Void Walker (Phase Shift) Tier 6 - Battleships (4 ships) End-game behemoths including Colossus (Orbital Strike), Annihilator (Planet Cracker), and more Tier 7 - Titans (Coming later) Massive capital ships that will dominate the battlefield

The goal: Create deep progression where every ship feels distinct and powerful, not just stat upgrades. The Tier 1 starter ships will always be viable - higher tiers offer different playstyles, not just power creep.

Completely Free No paywalls, no ads (yet?), just pure space combat fun. Still in beta so expect some jank, but the core gameplay is solid.

Why I Built This: I wanted to capture that feeling of early browser MMOs but with modern tech. The whole thing runs on Vue 3 + Phaser 3 + Supabase, and I'm building it in public. Everything's open source (link in comments if mods allow).

Looking For: Feedback on gameplay feel Bug reports (I'm sure there are plenty!) Ideas for new features Players to test multiplayer with

Try it out and let me know what you think! I'm actively developing and adding new features weekly. If you find bugs or have suggestions, drop them in the comments - I'm super responsive.

P.S. - Works best on desktop/laptop, but mobile is playable too (kinda).
