## About

Marches & Gnats is a browser-based coding puzzle game inspired by Advent of Code, but instead of writing code in a conventional programming language, you program a Turing machine.

Each quest presents a concrete problem and a minimal model of computation. You define transition rules, run the machine, inspect the output (or errors), and iterate until it works.

The game is set in 19th-century Estonia during the Romantic era and combines narrative with progressively harder problems, including arithmetic, sorting, parsing, ciphers, and cellular automata.
