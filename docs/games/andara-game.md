## About

I’m building a 2D space tactics game inspired by Star Trek and classic sci-fi. Movement, weapons, and shields already work with real-time execution and strict energy management. The goal is to survive by collecting energy while being hunted by a galactic federation. The project is deployed but still incomplete — feedback is very welcome.
