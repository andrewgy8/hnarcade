## About

Like Hangman you try to guess the word, one letter at a time.

Guess a letter correctly—a hit—and it will be revealed with a green background.

However, if you get a letter wrong, another word is added—now you have two words to guess, and so it goes on: each "miss" letter adds a word to the game.

A hit will reveal all the places that letter appears in all the words in play.

To complete the game, find all the letters in the words shown. The fewer words, the better!
