## About

The classic game with a twist—play in real-time, and there’s never a draw!

Shifting Tic Tac Toe was born from a desire to breathe new life into the classic game we all know and love.

By introducing the concept of a shifting board, we've created a game that's both familiar and fresh, challenging players to think several moves ahead while adapting to a constantly changing playing field.

It's the perfect blend of nostalgia and innovation, suitable for players of all ages and skill levels.
