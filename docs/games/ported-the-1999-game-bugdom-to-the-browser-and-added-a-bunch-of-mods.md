## About

I think the very first video game I ever played was Bugdom by Pangea Software, which came with the original iMac. There was also a shooter called Nanosaur, but my 7-year-old heart belonged to the more peaceable Bugdom, which featured a roly-poly named Rollie McFly needing to rescue ladybugs from evil fire ants and bees.
Upon seeing the port to modern systems (https://github.com/jorio/Bugdom), I figured it should be able to run entirely in-browser nowadays, and also that AI coding tools "should" be able to do this entire project for me. I ended up spending perhaps 20 hours on it with Claude Code, but we got there.

Once ported, I added a half-dozen mods that would have pleased my childhood self (like low-gravity mode and flying slugs & caterpillars mode), and a few that please my current self (like Dance Party mode).
