## About

Hallucinating Splines is a headless city simulator based off Micropolis, the open-source version of the original SimCity (1989). Anyone can pull an API and either have an LLM play the game or build ML/RL models to play and maximize population! What makes it fun is trying to wrangle AI agents into playing properly and optimizing for the right thing.
