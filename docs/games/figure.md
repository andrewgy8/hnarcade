description: "Figure is a daily logic puzzle game, sort of like Bejeweled meets Wordle. It's free to play right in your browser—no sign-up or login. Figure is very easy to learn, but the puzzles can be deceptively tricky. The graphics and sound design are lovingly handcrafted and polished for maximum fun and satisfaction. It's the kind of game that shines in a group text with friends (or frenemies) who like a little puzzling competition."
