## About

With Lore Labyrinth, you guide a yellow glowing orb through twisting corridors, razor-thin turns, and deceptive dead ends. One slip into a wall and you could lose some coins.

Along the journey, you will encounter some valuable collectibles like mushrooms, keys, and abilities that can turn disaster into triumph. Use them wisely!

Lock the cursor for precision, chase power-ups if the risk is worth it, and remember... every run is a one-of-a-kind challenge.

A weekly maze can be played [here](https://lorelabyrinth.entropicsystems.net/weekly)  if you'd prefer to not signup for infinite mazes.
