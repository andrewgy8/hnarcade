## About

A circuit simulator where you draw everything. NANDs and pixels. Build gates, ALUs, CPUs — whatever you want. Watch signals flow, rewind time, optimize your layout. Circuits are just images.

The simulation engine uses a variable-delay event-driven simulation that takes into account the topology of the wires to create a distance/propagation delay map based on Elmore delay calculation for trees. It also considers fanout — the higher the fanout, the higher the delay. Trees propagate differently than "lines," creating a more accurate simulation so players can develop intuition for real circuit design (sort of).
