## About

A first of its kind dual-snake control game that tests your ability to manage two snakes simultaneously in a classic retro-style arcade experience.

Playable using a combination of WASD/arrow keys for each snake or using a dual 4-way joystick.

**For the expert player dextrous enough to juggle while riding a unicycle.**
