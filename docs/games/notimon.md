## About

# 🌱 Notimon Garden turns note-taking into a game.

Every note you write becomes a living plant in a PixiJS-powered garden.

Link your notes with wiki-style backlinks and watch vines grow between them.

As you progress from fleeting thoughts to permanent knowledge, your notes evolve and you earn XP.

It's Zettelkasten meets Pokémon—making the act of building knowledge actually rewarding.

Write a note → plant grows
Add [[backlinks]] → vines appear
Level up your pet as you learn

## Why I built this:

Every note app feels like a graveyard.
You write notes and never see them again.

I wanted note-taking to feel ALIVE.

Open to feedback. What would you want to see next?

- Mobile app?
- Multiplayer gardens?
- AI assistant?
