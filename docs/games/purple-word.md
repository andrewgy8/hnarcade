## About

Purple Word is a daily word puzzle game where you try to guess the secret purple word using alphabetical clues.

Each day, there's a secret word to discover. The game tells you that the word is alphabetically between two boundary words.

Type a guess and press Enter. The game will tell you if your guess comes before or after the purple word alphabetically. Use the clues to narrow down the possibilities. You have 15 guesses to find the purple word.
