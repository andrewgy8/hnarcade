## About

It is a casual gaming platform focused on simple multiplayer games that can be played in person with a central screen (like a TV) or remotely via video chat. You can also play on your smart Android based TVs via the  [Smart TV App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gametje). It is also available directly in Discord as an [embedded activity](https://discord.com/discovery/applications/1215323000866607125). You can also host and play from a single phone removing the need for a central screen.

There are currently [8 playable games](https://gametje.com/games) with more being added every month. You can play anywhere from 2-16 players depending on the game.

It is playable in 10 languages and doesn’t require any downloads. Most games revolve around creativity in some shape or form. They can be played by just about anyone whether or not you consider yourself a “gamer”. If you can text on a phone, you can play these games.

There is a guest account which offers a short free trial (of all games). There is also a paid option to support the developer.
