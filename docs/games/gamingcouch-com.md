## About

Gaming Couch is a free, web-based party platform that turns your smartphone into a game controller and your computer into a party game. Gather up to 8 friends around a central screen and jump into 18 competitive mini-games, all handcrafted by a small indie team from Finland.

Unlike typical trivia or text-based party games, Gaming Couch is all about fast, chaotic, real-time action. There are no downloads or specific hardware required to play, everything runs directly in your browser. Currently in Early Access, it is the perfect choice for groups who love social gaming with a competitive twist!
