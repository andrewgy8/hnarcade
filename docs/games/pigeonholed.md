## About

This game was inspired by my experience working as a mailman. Specifically the part where you roughly sort letters by zip-code and occasionally deal with letters that are supposed to go to other postal offices or even other countries.

Once you understand the basic game mechanic, the only way you'll progress to the final level is by sharpening your geographical skills and remembering which country belong to which continent.

It's not for everyone, but for some - it may be a very addictive and fun little time-waster.
Your high-score is saved in localStorage so you can keep coming back and see if you can get further.
